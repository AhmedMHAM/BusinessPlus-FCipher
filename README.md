** What FCipher is?
Cipher application using for cipher text and files.
We using block cipher algorithm such as:
1-blowfish algorithm.
2-twofish algorithm.
3- threefish algorithm .
4- speck algorithm.

** How to use this application?
Application work in command line:
in cmd type:
c:\FCipher + key + plain Text
Example:
c:\FCipher 11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff Liza

** Road Map:
1- Developing cipher Algorithms.
2- Reading plain text and cipher it.
3- Using c language in developing.
4- Design GUI for Application
